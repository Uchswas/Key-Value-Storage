# Key Value Storage on Higher Dimentional Data

An Efficient storage system for Higher Dimentional Data 

This research work has done as my undergraduate thesis

Overview
--------

The Generalized Two-dimensional Array (G2A) can be used to represent an n-dimensional (nD) array by a 2 dimensional (2D) array.By mapping the higher dimenntional data into a 2D array, the index(x,y) of each element of that 2D array is used to generated the corospoding key of the record.After storing the keys in a bin-based file system, we design three quiry paradigms to search values 

- Exact Matching
- Single key Query
- Range Key Query



Build
-------
To create the keyvalue of the dataset run create.cpp
